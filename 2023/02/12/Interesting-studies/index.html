<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
Rooted in the novel and the mysterious, awe is a common experience in childhood, but research is almost silent with respect to the import of this emotion for children. Awe makes individuals feel small, thereby shifting their attention to the social world. Here, we studied the effects of art-elicited awe on children’s prosocial behavior toward an out-group and its unique physiological correlates. In two preregistered studies (Study 1: N = 159, Study 2: N = 353), children between 8 and 13 years old viewed movie clips that elicited awe, joy, or a neutral (control) response. Children who watched the awe-eliciting clip were more likely to spend their time on an effortful task (Study 1) and to donate their experimental earnings (Studies 1 and 2), all toward benefiting refugees. They also exhibited increased respiratory sinus arrhythmia, an index of parasympathetic nervous system activation associated with social engagement. We discuss implications for fostering prosociality by reimagining children’s environments to inspire awe at a critical age.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
A field experiment examined social approval in the form of Twitter “Likes” on individuals’ perceptions after retweeting a fictitious news story about a politician. The study incorporated research about feedback effects on self-perception online, partisan bias, and negativity principles. Participants read or retweeted a (verifiably false) news story via social media, and researchers appended systematic increments of Likes to the retweets. A baseline hypothesis test found no effect on perceptions due to retweeting versus simply reading a news story. Results supported a predicted three-way interaction effect between positive versus negative news story, political congruence with participants’ political party identification, and the reception of 0–22 Likes on perceptions of the politician. More Likes magnified negative perceptions of politicians, from fictitious news, when news stories were negative and focused on politicians from one’s opposite political party.</p>

<p>Very interesting, though very surprising why the 1st hypothesis was not supported.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
Online information repositories increasingly serve as memory aids in people’s lives. Access to such information stores, however, can result in false perceived equivalencies between web-based information and personal knowledge, which can in turn influence judgments of oneself, of information search tasks, and of the Internet itself. <em>Cognitive processing fluency, access to reliable web-based information</em>, and <em>actively searching for information</em> are shown in a series of experiments to be associated with judgments related to metacognition and task performance. In the context of online information repositories accessed via web search activities, people are shown to (a) overemphasize the degree to which they find the web to be a ready source of relevant information, (b) overestimate their future task performance and the ease of tasks, and © inflate their own perceived cognitive and memory abilities. Results also show that those who are least competent in task completion overestimate their relative performance, whereas the most competent underestimate theirs, and that the availability of web-based information can inflate people’s estimated performance, particularly among the more competent. Collectively, three interrelated studies add considerable new insight regarding the impacts of near-ubiquitous access to contemporary information-saturated environments.</p>

<p>Very interesting.</p>

Evidence from a systematic literature review</h2>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
With the increasing dominance of digital reading over traditional reading, gaining an understanding of the environmental impacts of the formats has become critical. This systematic literature review synthesizes and integrates the findings of studies comparing print reading with on-screen reading. The results reveal that the environmental impacts of printed and digital media depend on the usage rates and number of readers of both types of media as well as user behaviors and other parameters, and digital reading also has its own negative environmental impacts. Finally, research gaps are identified and a research agenda is proposed, including considering environmental performance in comparison studies, empirical investigations of actual user behaviors, and environmental savings for lending and sharing materials from libraries. This study aims to clear the misconception and change the popular stereotype that “e-reading is environmentally more sustainable than conventional reading,” and to provide stakeholders with more valuable information that is necessary to make environmentally informed decisions.</p>

<p>I never expected my two research interest could be conbined in this way. But I think the findings by these work are very plausible. I once brought iPad mini, Kindle, and iReader. However, the former two are very inconvenient for reading in my opinion. The last one is a bit better as its screen is much larger and supports handwriting. But it is broken in two months so I have to recycle it. Then I go back to buying physical books or read by phone.</p>
